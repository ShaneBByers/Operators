<b>Operators iPhone Application</b>

11/12/2016

This iPhone application tests the user's simple arithmetic ability in a fun and engaging way by providing the user with an incomplete math equation where the user must correctly place the operators of the equation in the correct positions for the equation to lead to the correct solution.

There are three game modes currently in the application: Original, Challenge, and Timed. 

In Original mode, the user can select the game difficulty and is then provided with an infinite string of random equations that must be solved such that the user gets as close as possible to the correct solution.

In Challenge mode, the user is presented pre-determined puzzles that must be solved precisely before being allowed to move on to the next puzzle. There are three difficulties with twenty-five puzzles in each difficulty.

In Timed mode, the user selects a difficulty and a time limit and must complete as many puzzles as possible within the time limit.

<b>NOTES</b>:

This application began as a Final Project for my Applications Programming course at Penn State. I have since augmented the code to include some more features and are continually updating and further developing the application.

<b>UPCOMING FEATURES</b>:

Beat your own high score in both Original and Timed modes.

Use hints to help solve difficult puzzles.

Portrait Mode for iPhones.

Include an iPad version.

Multiplayer - Both local and network play.

<b>KNOWN ISSUES</b>:

There are a number of minor bugs that exist in the application that need to be worked out.

Some UI/UX changes need to be made - Use a custom Navigation Controller System and a custom Alert View Controller system

Add some general settings for the application as well as extra settings for each of the game modes.
