<b>Operators iPhone Application</b>

August 1, 2019

This iPhone application tests the user's simple arithmetic ability in a fun and engaging way by providing the user with an incomplete math equation where the user must correctly place the operators of the equation in the correct positions for the equation to lead to the correct solution.

There are three game modes currently in the application: Original, Challenge, and Timed. 

In Original mode, the user can select the game difficulty and is then provided with an infinite string of random equations that must be solved such that the user gets as close as possible to the correct solution.

In Challenge mode, the user is presented pre-determined puzzles that must be solved precisely before being allowed to move on to the next puzzle. There are three difficulties with twenty-five puzzles in each difficulty.

In Timed mode, the user selects a difficulty and a time limit and must complete as many puzzles as possible within the time limit.

<b>NOTES</b>:

This application began as a Final Project for my Applications Programming course at Penn State. I have since augmented the code to include some more features and I am continually updating and further developing the application.

<b>UPCOMING FEATURES</b>:

Portrait Mode for iPhones.

Include an iPad version.

Multiplayer - Both local and network play.

<b>KNOWN ISSUES</b>:

No major known issues exist currently. A few small bugs may exist throughout the application.
